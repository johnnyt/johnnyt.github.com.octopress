JohnnyT (a.k.a. John Thornton) has been developing web applications for 15 years, the last 7 of which have been in Ruby. He was converted to Smalltalk in 2010 after looking into [MagLev](http://maglev.gemstone.com) ([GitHub](https://github.com/MagLev/maglev)) and discovering the magical world of [GemStone](http://www.gemstone.com) powering it all. He started a local Utah Smalltalk Users Group (USMUG) to help him in his quest to share the joy of Smalltalk with everyone he can. He works on Amber and SubWars (an open-source GPS browser based submarine game) to scratch his Smalltalk itch and earns his living working for Alliance Health Networks in Salt Lake City, Utah.
